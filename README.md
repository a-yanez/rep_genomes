# Selection for representative genomes out of a group of genomes  
The scripts in this repository were made in order to score bacterial genomes based in the gene families shared amongst them.  

## Things needed for the scripts to work
You will need a *.end* output file from FastOrtho (you still can get FastOrtho [here](https://github.com/olsonanl/FastOrtho)). Also, a list of the genome file names used for the BLAST input for FastOrtho.
 
## The scripts
*MatrixMaker.pl* and *MatrixMaker_counter.pl* are perl scripts that use the *.end* output file to generate matrixes. *MatrixMaker.pl* creates a simple presence-abscence matrix of the families found within a genome set. The matrix generated by *MatrixMaker_counter.pl* displays the number of sequences per genome within each family.  

*OrthoScore_simple.pl* and *OrthoScore_mode.pl* are the scripts that perform the scoring process using the matrixes created by MatrixMaker scripts. 

### How does the scoring works?
The "simple" script explores each gene family and explores how many different genes have a member present and scores the family accordingly, that means, a gene family present in every genome in the genome set has a higher score than one that is only present in a few. The total score for a single genome is equal to the sum of all the individual scores of the gene families it possesses.

The "mode" script has a similar approach, however while making the sum for the total score of a given genome it penalizes the score of each gene family deppending of the mode for the number of gene members per genome within each family. Lets say, genome A has 2 members within gene family 1 and the mode of member number amongst the genome set is 1, then family 1 score for genome A will be penalized according to the difference with the mode.
