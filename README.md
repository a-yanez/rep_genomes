# Selection for representative genomes out of a group of genomes  
The scripts in this repository were made in order to score bacterial genomes based in the gene families shared amongst them.  

## Things needed for the scripts to work
You will need a *.end* output file from FastOrtho (you still can get FastOrtho [here](https://github.com/olsonanl/FastOrtho)). Also, a list of the genome file names used for the BLAST input for FastOrtho.
 
## The scripts
*MatrixMaker.pl* and *OrthoCounter.pl* are perl scripts that use the *.end* output file to generate matrixes. *MatrixMaker.pl* creates a simple presence-abscence matrix of the families found within a genome set. The matrix generated by *OrthoCounter.pl* displays the number of sequences per genome within each family.
